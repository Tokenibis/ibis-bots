    "description": "The Japanese New Year (\u6b63\u6708, Sh\u014dgatsu) is an annual festival with its own customs. Since 1873, the official Japanese New Year has been celebrated according to the Gregorian calendar, on January 1 of each year, New Year's Day (\u5143\u65e5, Ganjitsu). However, some traditional events of the Japanese New Year are partially celebrated on the first day of the year on the modern Tenp\u014d calendar, the last official lunisolar calendar which was used until 1872 in Japan."

    "description": "New Year's Day, also simply called New Year, is observed on 1 January, the first day of the year on the modern Gregorian calendar as well as the Julian calendar. In pre-Christian Rome under the Julian calendar, the day was dedicated to Janus, god of gateways and beginnings, for whom January is also named. As a date in the Gregorian calendar of Christendom, New Year's Day liturgically marked the Feast of the Naming and Circumcision of Jesus, which is still observed as such in the Anglican Church and Lutheran Church. The Roman Catholic Church celebrates on this day the Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God. In present day, with most countries now using the Gregorian calendar as their de facto calendar, New Year's Day is among the most celebrated public holidays in the world, often observed with fireworks at the stroke of midnight as the new year starts in each time zone. Other global New Year's Day traditions include making New Year's resolutions and calling one's friends and family."

This legal transition of copyright works into the public domain usually happens every year on 1 January based on the individual copyright laws of each country. The observance of a \"Public Domain Day\" was initially informal; the earliest known mention was in 2004 by Wallace McLean (a Canadian public domain activist), with support for the idea echoed by Lawrence Lessig. Several websites list the authors whose works are entering the public domain each January 1. There are activities in countries around the world by various organizations all under the banner Public Domain Day."

    "description": "Berchtoldstag (also Bechtelistag, B\u00e4chtelistag, Berchtelistag, B\u00e4rzelistag, in Liechtenstein Bechtelstag, Bechtle) is an Alemannic holiday, known in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. It is near New Year's Day, during the Rauhn\u00e4chte, in Switzerland nearly always on 2 January (in Frauenfeld on the third Monday in January), with the status of a public holiday in a number of cantons (AG, BE, FR, GL, JU, LU, NE, OW, SH, SO, TG, VD, ZG, ZH). Its observation is attested since the 14th century, although celebrations were limited after the Protestant Reformation. Various theories exist concerning the holiday's name. Blessed Berchtold of Engelberg Abbey died circa 2 November 1197, and the abbey could have been important enough to translate his feast out of advent. According to others, it celebrates a hunting trip circa 1191 by Duke Berchtold V of Z\u00e4hringen, who decided to name his new city after the first animal he killed on that trip, hence Bern, Switzerland. Another theory associates the name with the verb 'berchten', which means \"to walk around, asking for food\". The name may also relate to Perchta, mythological or folkloric female guardian of animals, and sometimes leader of the Wild Hunt, since Twelfth Night traditions even in the Spanish Pyrenees can feature visits from a transformed human/animal. The most likely explanation is offered by the Schweizerisches Idiotikon that considers it derived from Middle High German berhttac or berhteltac, which translated the Greek epiphanias. Indeed, Berchtoldstag especially occurs in Protestant regions where Epiphany has been abolished and replaced by a second day-off after New Year's Day. In the German-speaking cantons of Zurich and Thurgau as well as some parts of Central Switzerland, families celebrate the holiday with meals at pubs or offered by traditional societies. The Argovian village of Hallwil holds a mask parade with entries symbolizing fertility, age, ugliness, wisdom, vice, etc. In the French-speaking Vaud, children celebrate Berchtoldstag with neighborhood parties which include folk dancing and singing. Nuts are associated with this holiday. They are both eaten in a \"nut feast\" and used for games. Children build \"hocks\" of four nuts close together on the ground with a fifth nut balanced on top."

    "description": "Distaff Day, also called Roc Day or Rock Day, is 7 January, the day after the feast of the Epiphany. It is also known as Saint Distaff's Day, one of the many unofficial holidays in Catholic nations. The distaff, or roc, used in spinning was the medieval symbol of women's work. In many European cultural traditions, women resumed their household work after the twelve days of Christmas. Women of all classes would spend their evenings spinning on the wheel. During the day, they would carry a drop spindle with them. Spinning was the only means of turning raw wool, cotton or flax into thread, which could then be woven into cloth. Men have their own way of celebrating this occasion, called Plough Monday, the first Monday after Epiphany when men are supposed to get back to work. Every few years, Distaff Day and Plough Monday fall on the same day. Often the men and women would play pranks on each other during this celebration, as described by Robert Herrick in his poem \"St. Distaff's Day,\" which appears in his Hesperides (1648). In the 20th century, Herrick's poem was set to music. Some modern craft groups have taken up the celebration of Distaff Day as part of their New Year celebrations. Distaff Day gatherings are held, large and small, throughout local fiber communities."

    "description": "National Nothing Day is an \"un-event\" proposed in 1972 by columnist Harold Pullman Coffin and observed annually on January 16 since 1973, when it was added to Chase's Calendar of Events.  It is not actually a public holiday, as that requires an act of Congress.Its purpose is: to provide Americans with one National day when they can just sit without celebrating, observing or honoring anything. It is sponsored by Coffin's National Nothing Foundation, registered in Capitola, California. The third Monday of every January has subsequently been inaugurated as Martin Luther King Jr. Day which falls between the 15th and 21st. This means that one-in-seven January 16's now fall on a public holiday (e.g. Monday, 16th Jan 2012), effectively usurping the very nature of National Nothing Day. In contrast, the Realist Society of Canada (RSC) has a religious holiday called THABS ( \"There has always been something\" Day, pronounced ). THABS Day is dedicated to the celebration of the \"the realization that 'if there was ever nothing, there would be nothing now'\". It is celebrated July 8 of each year. Coffin's commemoration, when proposed in 1972, was not a novel idea. In 1956 the Associated Press circulated the proclamation by the Mayor James W. Morgan of Birmingham, Alabama of a \"National Nothing Week\" to be celebrated 26 February through 3 March that year. The news item appeared in newspapers nationwide."

The event was photographed by a local man and photos were published, inciting anger and riots throughout Egypt. January 25 was declared as an official holiday in 2009 by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to recognize the efforts of Egyptian police to maintain security and stability in Egypt and acknowledge their sacrifices. When the Egyptian police drifted away from their duty of keeping civilians and country safe and began humiliating people to back Mubarak's corrupt regime, a number of Egyptian opposition groups had chosen this day to start mass protests in 2011, which turned into a massive popular revolution which swept across the country on January 28. This revolution is known as the Revolution of 25 January. President Hosni Mubarak stepped down from office, and the Supreme Council of the armed forces took over the governing of the country."

In this day rallies in government campus were going on. By Observing the new voters, who have attained the age of 18 years, were showing less interest in getting enrolled in the electoral rolls, she said the level of their enrollment was as low as 20 to 25 per cent in certain cases. \"In order to effectively deal with this problem, the Election Commission has decided to take up a vigorous exercise to identify all eligible voters attaining the age of 18 years as of January 1 every year in each of the 8.5 lakh polling stations across the country,\" she said. Such eligible voters would be enrolled on time and handed over their Electoral Photo Identity Card (EPIC) on January 25 every year, Soni said, adding this initiative is expected to give the youth a sense of empowerment, pride and inspire them to exercise their franchise. The new voters would be provided with a badge with its logo \"Proud to be a voter - Ready to vote\", she said. The theme of NVD 2016 is \u2018Inclusive and qualitative participation\u2019 reiterating the commitment towards reaching out to the last voter and promoting informed and ethical voting. The slogan 'No Voter to be left behind' has been coined to further emphasis the focus on inclusiveness.

    "description": "Data Privacy Day (known in Europe as Data Protection Day) is an international event that occurs every year on 28th January. The purpose of Data Privacy Day is to raise awareness and promote privacy and data protection best practices. It is currently observed in the United States, Canada, Israel and 47 European countries. Data Privacy Day's educational initiative originally focused on raising awareness among businesses as well as users about the importance of protecting the privacy of their personal information online, particularly in the context of social networking. The educational focus has expanded over the past four years to include families, consumers and businesses. In addition to its educational initiative, Data Privacy Day promotes events and activities that stimulate the development of technology tools that promote individual control over personally identifiable information; encourage compliance with privacy laws and regulations; and create dialogues among stakeholders interested in advancing data protection and privacy. The international celebration offers many opportunities for collaboration among governments, industry, academia, nonprofits, privacy professionals and educators. The Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data was opened for signature by the Council of Europe on January 28, 1981. This convention is currently in the process of being updated in order to reflect new legal challenges caused by technological development. The Convention on Cybercrime is also protecting the integrity of data systems and thus of privacy in cyberspace. Privacy including data protection is also protected by Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The day was initiated by the Council of Europe to be first held in 2007 as the European Data Protection Day.Two years later, on January 26, 2009, the United States House of Representatives passed House Resolution HR 31 by a vote of 402\u20130, declaring January 28 National Data Privacy Day. On January 28, 2009, the Senate passed Senate Resolution 25 also recognizing January 28, 2009 as National Data Privacy Day. The United States Senate also recognized Data Privacy Day in 2010 and 2011."

In its association with the Lunar New Year, spring Setsubun can be and was previously thought of as a sort of New Year's Eve, and so was accompanied by a special ritual to cleanse away all the evil of the former year and drive away disease-bringing evil spirits for the year to come. This special ritual is called mamemaki (\u8c46\u6492\u304d, \"bean scattering\"). Setsubun has its origins in tsuina (\u8ffd\u513a), a Chinese custom introduced to Japan in the eighth century."

This congress was the first time that Norwegian and Swedish S\u00e1mi came together across their national borders to work together to find solutions for common problems. In 1992, at the 15th S\u00e1mi Conference in Helsinki, a resolution was passed that S\u00e1mi National Day should be celebrated on February 6 to commemorate the first S\u00e1mi congress in 1917. Sami National Day is for all S\u00e1mi, regardless of where they live and on that day the S\u00e1mi flag should be flown and the S\u00e1mi anthem is sung in the local S\u00e1mi language. The first time Sami National Day was celebrated was in 1993, when the International Year of Indigenous People was proclaimed open in Jokkmokk, Sweden by the United Nations. Since then, celebrating the day has become increasingly popular. In Norway it is compulsory for municipal administrative buildings to fly the Norwegian flag, and optionally also the Sami flag, on February 6. Particularly notable is the celebration in Norway's capital Oslo, where the bells in the highest tower of Oslo City Hall play the Sami national anthem as the flags go up. Some larger places have taken to arranging festivities also in the week around the Sami National Day. By coincidence, 6 February was also the date representatives of the S\u00e1mi of the Kola Peninsula gathered annually to meet with Russian bureaucrats to debate and decide on issues of relevance to them. This assembly, called the Kola Sobbar, has been dubbed the \"first S\u00e1mi Parliament\" by the researcher Johan Albert Kalstad. However, the founding of the Kola Sobbar did not influence the choice of the date for S\u00e1mi People's Day, as the assembly existed only during the late 1800s and was largely forgotten until the early 2000s."

The ZANU\u2013PF Youth League has commemorated Robert Mugabe on his birthday in February for years as part of its February 21st Movement which was established in 1986. The youth arm of the ruling party lobbied for the former president's birthday to be declared a national holiday for what the organization says the leader's role in empowering the country's youth. The day was formally recognized as a national holiday on February 24 2017 on the same day President Emmerson Mnangagwa was sworn in as leader of Zimbabwe following a coup which led to the resignation of Mugabe as President. The holiday was formalized through the publication of a statutory instrument on The Herald under the virtue of section 2 of the Public Holidays and Prohibition of Business Act."

The date was selected because more than a century earlier (February 24, 1821), the \"Plan de Iguala\" or \"Plan de las tres garant\u00edas\" was proclaimed by Agustin de Iturbide and General Vicente Guerrero. This plan was based in three principles: \"Religion, Independence and Unity\", which were represented on the flag's colors. On this same date, Jose Magdaleno Ocampo tailored the first three color flag for what would soon be an independent Mexico. This flag, commonly known as the \"Pendon Trigarante\", had the colors: white, green and red in that order, arranged diagonally with three eight-point gold stars, one on the center of each color banner. When the Pledge is recited, it is customary to salute the flag with the raised arm Bellamy Salute while speaking. When the flag is being paraded, the arm is held across the chest, palm parallel to the ground."

During the Second Boer War, the surrender of Piet Cronj\u00e9 to the British after the equally resounding Battle of Paardeberg took place on 27 February 1900, leading Paul Kruger to declare, \"The English have taken our Majuba Day away from us\". After the Second Boer War, with the Transvaal Colony (1902\u201310) under British rule, Majuba Day was replaced by Victoria Day (24 May).

After women gained suffrage in Soviet Russia in 1917, March 8 became a national holiday there. The day was then predominantly celebrated by the socialist movement and communist countries until it was adopted by the feminist movement in about 1967. The United Nations began celebrating the day in 1977. Commemoration of International Women's Day today ranges from being a public holiday in some countries to being largely ignored elsewhere. In some places, it is a day of protest; in others, it is a day that celebrates womanhood."

The H\u014dnen festival and ceremony celebrate the blessings of a bountiful harvest and all manner of prosperity and fertility. The venerated Shinto deities is Mitoshi (\u5fa1\u6b73\u795e, Mitoshi-no-kami) and female deity Tamahime (\u7389\u59eb\u547d, Tamahime-no-mikoto). Mitoshi is the son of the Shinto male deity Toshigami (\u5e74\u795e) or known by local as \u014ctoshi (\u5927\u6b73\u795e, \u014ctoshi-no-kami) and grandson of the Shinto deity Susanoo. Tamahime is a princess and the daughter of \u014c'arata (\u5927\u8352\u7530\u547d, \u014c'arata-no-Mikoto), the matriarch of Owari clan (\u5c3e\u5f35\u6c0f) of her husband Take'inadane (\u5065\u7a32\u7a2e\u547d, Take'inadane-no-mikoto) who were blessed with two sons and four daughters. After her husband's death, she returned to his hometown Arata (situated close to Komaki), encouraged to cultivate with the help of her father \u014c'arata, honor and achieved his achievements. The best known of these festivals takes place in the town of Komaki, just north of Nagoya City. The festival's main features are Shinto priests playing musical instruments, a parade of ceremonially garbed participants, all-you-can-drink sake, and a wooden phallus. The 280 kg (620 pound), 2.5 meter (96 inch)-long, 200-250 year old Japanese cypress wooden phallus called youbutsu (\u967d\u7269, lit. \"the male object\") or \u014d-owase-gata (\u5927\u7537\u830e\u5f62, lit. \"the grand Phallus shape/ object\") which is carried from a shrine called Shinmei Sha (in even-numbered years) in Komaki on a large hill or from Kumano-sha Shrine (in odd-numbered years), to a shrine called Tagata Jinja (\u7530\u7e23\u795e\u793e) in Komaki, Tagata, Aichi Prefecture. The festival starts with celebration and preparation at 10:00 a.m. at Tagata Jinja, where all sorts of foods and souvenirs (mostly phallus-shaped or related) are sold. Sake is also passed out freely from large wooden barrels. At about 2:00 p.m. everyone gathers at Shinmei Sha for the start of the procession. Shinto priests say prayers and impart blessings on the participants and mikoshi, as well as on the large wooden phallus, which are to be carried along the parade route. When the procession makes its way down to Tagata Jinja the phallus in its mikoshi is spun furiously before it is set down and more prayers are said. Everyone then gathers in the square outside Tagata Jinja and waits for the mochi nage, at which time the crowd is showered with small rice cakes which are thrown down by the officials from raised platforms. The festival concludes at about 4:30 p.m."

IFSB members focused on the following message during 1953: Calling occupants of interplanetary craft! Calling occupants of interplanetary craft that have been observing our planet EARTH. We of IFSB wish to make contact with you. We are your friends, and would like you to make an appearance here on EARTH. Your presence before us will be welcomed with the utmost friendship. We will do all in our power to promote mutual understanding between your people and the people of EARTH. Please come in peace and help us in our EARTHLY problems. Give us some sign that you have received our message. Be responsible for creating a miracle here on our planet to wake up the ignorant ones to reality. Let us hear from you. We are your friends. The 1953 celebration is referenced in the song \"Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft\", recorded in 1976 by Klaatu and later covered by The Carpenters.

'the Day of the Festival of Patrick'), is a cultural and religious celebration held on 17 March, the traditional death date of Saint Patrick (c.\u2009385 \u2013 c.\u2009461), the foremost patron saint of Ireland. Saint Patrick's Day was made an official Christian feast day in the early 17th century and is observed by the Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion (especially the Church of Ireland), the Eastern Orthodox Church, and the Lutheran Church. The day commemorates Saint Patrick and the arrival of Christianity in Ireland, and celebrates the heritage and culture of the Irish in general. Celebrations generally involve public parades and festivals, c\u00e9il\u00eds, and the wearing of green attire or shamrocks. Christians who belong to liturgical denominations also attend church services and historically the Lenten restrictions on eating and drinking alcohol were lifted for the day, which has encouraged and propagated the holiday's tradition of alcohol consumption. Saint Patrick's Day is a public holiday in the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador (for provincial government employees), and the British Overseas Territory of Montserrat. It is also widely celebrated in the United Kingdom, Canada, United States, Brazil, Argentina, Australia and New Zealand, especially amongst Irish diaspora. Saint Patrick's Day is celebrated in more countries than any other national festival. Modern celebrations have been greatly influenced by those of the Irish diaspora, particularly those that developed in North America. However, there has been criticism of Saint Patrick's Day celebrations for having become too commercialised and for fostering negative stereotypes of the Irish people."

Being the official holiday of the Mongolian Armed Forces, it is the equivalent of Defender of the Fatherland Day in Russia and/or the male version of International Women's Day. In March 1921, during the early stages of the Mongolian Revolution of 1921, a Mongolian guerrilla army led by Damdin S\u00fckhbaatar as Supreme Commander launched an offensive at the Chinese garrison at Kyakhta Maimaicheng (Altanbulag, Selenge). The offensive followed a failed attempt by the Mongolian People's Party central committee to reach an ultimatum with Chinese troops. Despite S\u00fckhbaatar's 400-man army being heavily outnumbered by the Chinese, he led his troops to victory in taking the town.  This event is considered to be the date that gave birth to the modern Mongolian Armed Forces and the preceding Mongolian People's Army. The holiday is celebrated in many different ways as it is both a civilian and military holiday. The military side usually conducts promotion and award ceremonies. The Chief of General Staff usually takes part in a wreath laying ceremony on S\u00fckhbaatar Square. The President of Mongolia in his/her position as commander-in-chief usually sends greetings on the holiday, often visiting the country's National Defense University. Military tattoos are held in the capital of Ulanbaatar as well as gala concerts."

    "description": "Maryland Day is a legal holiday in the U.S. state of Maryland. It is observed on the anniversary of the March 25, 1634, landing of the first European settlers in the Province of Maryland, the third English colony to be settled in British North America. On this day settlers from The Ark and The Dove first stepped foot onto Maryland soil, at St. Clement's Island in the Potomac River. The settlers were about 150 in number, departed from Gravesend on the Thames River downstream from London. Three Jesuit priests were collected from Cowes on the Isle of Wight in England where they avoided having to give the oath of allegiance and supremacy to the King. The colony's grant was renewed to Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, (1605-1675), two years prior by Charles I of England, after first being given to his father Sir George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, (1574-1632), along with the title of \"Lord Baltimore\", and a first grant in Acadia, in Newfoundland, (modern Canada), (title named after lands and town Baltimore, in Ireland) who had served the King in many official and personal capacities as Secretary of State, 1619-1625 (despite his conversion to Roman Catholicism). In thanksgiving for the safe landing, Jesuit Father Andrew White celebrated the Mass for the colonists led by the younger brother of Lord Baltimore, Leonard Calvert, (1606-1647), who served as the first governor, and perhaps for the first time ever in this part of the world on the first landing at Blackistone Island, later known as St. Clement's Island off the northern shore of the Potomac River, which was the new border between the new colony and the earlier English settlements in Virginia) and erected a large cross. The landing coincided with the Feast of the Annunciation, a holy day honoring Mary, and the start of the new year in England's legal calendar (prior to 1752). Maryland Day on 25 March celebrates the 1634 landing at St Clements. Later the colonists and their two ships sailed further back down river to the southeast to settle a capital at St. Mary's City near the point where the Potomac flows into the Chesapeake Bay. The holiday began its official observance in 1903, the date chosen by the State's Board of Education to honor Maryland history and to increase the teaching of state and local histories in the public schools. In 1916, the General Assembly (state legislature) authorized \"Maryland Day\" as a legal holiday (Chapter 633, Acts of 1916). Ceremonies, activities, historical pageants and other commemorative events are held annually in Historic St. Mary's City in St. Mary's County, the first colonial capital of the province and the site of several reconstructed provincial and colonial structures including the first State House with a tourism/historical agency which runs operations and provides interpretative information. This was where the first sessions of the General Assembly of Maryland were held, over 375 years ago. An annual ceremony is held at the base of the 1908 statue of Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, (1605-1675), on the steps of the west front of the Baltimore City Circuit Courthouse (renamed 1985 after national civil rights leader Clarence M. Mitchell, Jr., 1911-1984) facing St. Paul Street with the ceremony continuing further inside in a ceremonial courtroom. The annual Maryland Day weekend celebration is held in the Four Rivers Heritage Area of Maryland (from the State Capital in the City of Annapolis to Southern Anne Arundel County). This Maryland Day celebration highlights Maryland's history, heritage, culture and environment at approximately 20 sites with over 40 events during Maryland's Birthday weekend. The 2020 Maryland Day celebration was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic."

Its main purpose is remembering the deaths of brothers Rafael and Eduardo Vergara Toledo, which occurred on March 29, 1985 during the dictatorship in Chile. The brothers were reportedly members of a pro-Marxist, anti-dictatorship insurgent group called MIR. The commemoration is a call for human rights awareness and inquiry into several cases of extra judicial killings during the dictatorship. Violence often involves throwing rocks against buildings, vehicles, and police, as well as fire-bombing with Molotov cocktails. Given the general unrest-prone day, violence is directed not only against public and government buildings, but also against private property and commercial enterprises such as electrical wiring and power stations. These actions also serve as a cover-up for lootings and other deliberate criminal actions done by organized groups. Most of the violent protests are in the Villa Francia neighborhood, in Estaci\u00f3n Central Commune of western Santiago, the place where the Vergara Toledo family resides. Whereas some commemorations in Chile involve peaceful marches, the D\u00eda del Joven Combatiente is well known to warrant violent action from hooded insurgents, this has caused local media to refer to the event as the D\u00eda del Joven Delincuente (Day of the Young Delinquent). Generally, local media and government agencies have disseminated warnings to the public to stay indoors, expect power outages (particularly near the mentioned neighborhood \"Villa Francia\") and several institutions such as Universities end classes early for students to return home before nightfall, which is mostly when the violent attacks happen. It is also common to expect public transportation to be sparse due to frequent attacks on public buses. A similarly violent-prone and disruptive day is September 11, the day of the 1973 coup d'\u00e9tat."

In 1976, in response to the Israeli government's announcement of a plan to expropriate thousands of dunams of land for state purposes, a general strike and marches were organized in Arab towns from the Galilee to the Negev. In the ensuing confrontations with the Israeli army and police, six unarmed Arab citizens were killed, about one hundred were wounded, and hundreds of others arrested. Scholarship on the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict recognizes Land Day as a pivotal event in the struggle over land and in the relationship of Arab citizens to the Israeli state and body politic. It is significant in that it was the first time since 1948 that Arabs in Israel organized a response to Israeli policies as a Palestinian national collective. An important annual day of commemoration in the Palestinian national political calendar ever since, it is marked not only by Arab citizens of Israel, but also by Palestinians all over the world."

On taking power in 1971, the Labour Government indicated it wanted to re-negotiate the lease agreement with the United Kingdom. Following protracted and sometimes tense talks, a new agreement was signed whereby the lease was extended till the end of March 1979 at a vastly increased rent. On 31 March 1979 the last British Forces left Malta. For the first time in a millennium, Malta was no longer a military base of a foreign power and it became independent de facto as well as de jure. The main events of the activities commemorating this date take place at the Freedom Day Monument at Birgu (Vittoriosa) and at the War Memorial in Floriana. In the afternoon the Grand Harbour hosts a competitive regatta. The regatta often attracts thousands of spectators and participants from the three big cities (Birgu, Bormla and Isla), as well as coastal towns.

This resolution was passed and adopted without a vote in the UN General Assembly, mainly as a supplement to previous UN initiatives to improve human rights. World Autism Day is one of only seven official health-specific UN Days. The day itself brings individual autism organizations together all around the world to aid in things like research, diagnoses, treatment, and acceptance for those with a developmental path affected by autism."

In a span of less than ten years\u20141807 to 1816\u2014the Banda Oriental and its capital city of Montevideo were occupied by the English, retaken by the Spanish, and invaded by the Portuguese. In 1816 Portuguese Brazil took Banda Oriental from the north, ousting the province's hero Jos\u00e9 Gervasio Artigas in 1820 and forcing him into exile in Paraguay. Banda Oriental became a province of Brazil, which achieved independence from Portugal in 1822. In 1825 a group of exiled Uruguayan fighters called the 33 Orientals returned from Buenos Aires. They were led by Juan Antonio Lavalleja, who had fought with the exiled Artigas. The 33 Orientals secretly crossed the Plata River, landing on the Eastern Bank on 19 April. There they planted what would be known as the flag of the 33 Orientals and took an oath to kick the Brazilian government out of Uruguay. Four months later, on 25 August 1825, Uruguay officially declared its independence from Brazil. After 500 days of fighting (the Argentina\u2013Brazil War), Brazil recognized Uruguay's independence in 1828. Celebrations held on this date correspond with celebrations held on their National Independence day, with the laying of wreaths, speeches, and particularly special prayer programs held in churches all over Uruguay, recognizing the 33 brave men who had sparked the revolution towards their independence."

In 1969 at a UNESCO Conference in San Francisco, peace activist John McConnell proposed a day to honor the Earth and the concept of peace, to first be celebrated on March 21, 1970, the first day of spring in the northern hemisphere. This day of nature's equipoise was later sanctioned in a proclamation written by McConnell and signed by Secretary General U Thant at the United Nations. A month later a United States Senator Gaylord Nelson proposed the idea to hold a nationwide environmental teach-in on April 22, 1970. He hired a young activist, Denis Hayes, to be the National Coordinator. Nelson and Hayes renamed the event \"Earth Day.\" Under the leadership of labor leader Walter Reuther, the United Auto Workers was the most instrumental outside financial and operational supporter of the first Earth Day. According to Hayes, \"Without the UAW, the first Earth Day would have likely flopped!\" Nelson was later awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom award in recognition of his work. The first Earth Day was focused on the United States. In 1990, Denis Hayes, the original national coordinator in 1970, took it international and organized events in 141 nations. On Earth Day 2016, the landmark Paris Agreement was signed by the United States, China, and some 120 other countries. This signing satisfied a key requirement for the entry into force of the historic draft climate protection treaty adopted by consensus of the 195 nations present at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. Numerous communities celebrate Earth Day Week, an entire week of activities focused on the environmental issues that the world faces."

The date is the anniversary of the Battle of Villalar, in which Castilian rebels called Comuneros were dealt a crushing defeat by the royalist forces of King Charles I in the Revolt of the Comuneros on April 23, 1521. Commemoration of the Battle of Villalar was closely associated with liberal politics in Spain from the late 18th century until the 1970s, as conservatives generally sympathized with the royal government. With the demise of General Franco's government, the day has broadened to a more general celebration of Castilian nationalism rather than only liberal politics. The government of Castile and Le\u00f3n established April 23 as an official holiday in 1986, although festivals have been held yearly since a decade earlier at Villalar.

    "description": "National Veterans' Day (Finnish: kansallinen veteraanip\u00e4iv\u00e4, Swedish: nationella veterandagen) is a remembrance day for all the war veterans of Finland. It is celebrated each year on 27 April. According to Moscow Armistice Finland was obliged to demand the National Socialist German troops to leave Finland by 15 September 1944, which was technically impossible. The Germans executed the operation Tanne Ost trying to occupy Hogland from the Finnish armed forces and defend the Estonian coast from the Soviet Baltic Navy on the Eastern isles of the Baltic Sea. The Finns, on their behalf, at the request of the Allied controlling committee, attacked the Germans in Pudasj\u00e4rvi on 28 September 1944, which was the end of the phoney war and the beginning of the real War of Lapland. It and the whole World War II in Finland ended on 27 April 1945, when the very last German troops had left Finland and crossed the border to the German-occupied Norway in the municipality of Enonteki\u00f6 and the Finnish Defence Forces achieved the Three-Country Cairn of Finland, Norway and Sweden. Even if the day reminds a victory day, it is not celebrated as such. Among the events there are services in the Evangelical Lutheran churches, honorary guards on the war hero tombs, deposing wreath and the collecting money for the charity of the last war veterans' needs."

    "description": "International Workers' Day, also known as Labour Day in some countries and often referred to as May Day, is a celebration of labourers and the working classes that is promoted by the international labour movement and occurs every year on May Day (1 May). While it may belong to a tradition of spring festivals, the date was chosen in 1889 for political reasons by the Marxist International Socialist Congress, which met in Paris and established the Second International as a successor to the earlier International Workingmen's Association. They adopted a resolution for a \"great international demonstration\" in support of working-class demands for the eight-hour day. The date had been chosen by the American Federation of Labor to continue an earlier campaign for the eight-hour day in the United States, which had culminated in the Haymarket affair, which occurred in Chicago on 4 May 1886. May Day subsequently became an annual event. The 1904 Sixth Conference of the Second International, called on \"all Social Democratic Party organisations and trade unions of all countries to demonstrate energetically on the First of May for the legal establishment of the eight-hour day, for the class demands of the proletariat, and for universal peace.\" The first of May is a national, public holiday in many countries across the world, in most cases as \"International Workers\u2019 Day\" or a similar name. Some countries celebrate a Labour Day on other dates significant to them, such as the United States and Canada, which celebrate Labor Day on the first Monday of September."

    "description": "In Singapore, May Day (or Labour Day) is celebrated on the 1st of May each year as a mark of solidarity amongst workers. The celebration of May Day as a public holiday began only in 1960 after the People's Action Party came into power. Before then, only workers defined as such under the Labour Ordinance 1955 and those defined as industrial clerks under the Clerks Employment Ordinance 1957 were given paid holidays. May Day is a day of special significance for organised workers, as it serves to remind others what their collective strength has achieved for workers. By making it a public holiday, the Government of Singapore had intended it to be a day set aside in honour of workers and their contributions to the country. It also makes it easier for workers to come together for celebrations. In the past, rallies and resolutions also form the central features of May Day celebrations. Through these activities, organised workers symbolically express their unity of purpose and their faith in solidarity. Today, May Day celebrations are increasingly planned for the enjoyment of workers and their families, which include events like the May Day Family Fiesta."

The Russian Federation has officially recognised 9 May since its formation in 1991 and considers it a non-working holiday even if it falls on a weekend (in which case any following Monday will be a non-working holiday). The holiday was similarly celebrated there while the country was part of the Soviet Union. Most other countries in Europe observe Victory in Europe Day, 8 May, as a national remembrance or victory day."

During the 20th century, Australian government policies caused children to be separated from their families, with the intention of assimilating them into White Australian culture. This resulted in what became known as the \"Stolen Generations\", with the effects of these traumatic removals being felt by succeeding generations even today. On 26 May 1997, the Bringing Them Home report, the result of a government inquiry into the practice, was tabled in Parliament. The report made many recommendations, including that state and federal governments should issue formal apologies and that funding should be provided to help deal with the consequences of the policies.

The Statehood Day is the National Day of Croatia, being both an official holiday and a day off work. On 30 May 1990, the first modern multi-party Croatian Parliament convened, following the 1990 Croatian parliamentary election. This date was from 1990 to 2002 marked as the Statehood Day. The Government of Ivica Ra\u010dan moved the Statehood Day to 25 June in 2002, and 30 May was marked as a minor holiday, one that was not an off-day. On 25 June, after the independence referendum held on 19 May 1991, Croatia proclaimed its independence, but due to the negotiation of the Brioni Agreement, a three-month moratorium was placed on the implementation of the decision and the Parliament cut all remaining ties with Yugoslavia on 8 October 1991. 8 October was celebrated as the Independence Day from 2002 to 2019. Slovenia declared independence from Yugoslavia at the same time, and its Statehood Day coincided with the Croatian Statehood Day, on 25 June. On 14 November 2019, the Croatian Parliament adopted a new law on holidays, and moved the Statehood Day back to 30 May. Typical state activities on the occasion involve speeches by the President of Croatia and other dignitaries, as well as commemoration of the Croatian War of Independence."

It was spurred by ratifications of ILO Convention No. 138 on the minimum age for employment and ILO Convention No. 182 on the worst forms of child labour. The World Day Against Child Labour, which is held every year on June 12, is intended to foster the worldwide movement against child labour."

    "description": "In the United States, Flag Day is celebrated on June 14. It commemorates the adoption of the flag of the United States on June 14, 1777, by resolution of the Second Continental Congress. The Flag Resolution, passed on June 14, 1777, stated: \"Resolved, That the flag of the thirteen United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation.\" This design was created by Francis Hopkinson, a Continental Congressman from New Jersey and a consultant to the design of the Great Seal of the United States. The United States Army also celebrates the U.S. Army birthday on this date; Congress adopted \"the American continental army\" after reaching a consensus position in the Committee of the Whole on June 14, 1775. In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson issued a proclamation that officially established June 14 as Flag Day; on August 3, 1949, National Flag Day was established by an Act of Congress. Flag Day is not an official federal holiday. Title 36 of the United States Code, Subtitle I, Part A, CHAPTER 1, \u00a7 110 is the official statute on Flag Day; however, it is at the president's discretion to officially proclaim the observance. On June 14, 1937, Pennsylvania became the first U.S. state to celebrate Flag Day as a state holiday, beginning in the town of Rennerdale. New York Statutes designate the second Sunday in June as Flag Day, a state holiday. Perhaps the oldest continuing Flag Day parade is in Fairfield, Washington. Beginning in 1909 or 1910, Fairfield has held a parade every year since, with the possible exception of 1918, and celebrated the \"Centennial\" parade in 2010, along with some other commemorative events. Appleton, Wisconsin, claims to be the oldest National Flag Day parade in the nation, held annually since 1950. Quincy, Massachusetts, has had an annual Flag Day parade since 1952 and claims it \"is the longest-running parade of its kind\" in the U.S. The largest Flag Day parade had been held annually in Troy, New York until 2017, which based its parade on the Quincy parade and typically draws 50,000 spectators. In addition, the Three Oaks, Michigan, Flag Day Parade is held annually on the weekend of Flag Day and is a three-day event and they claim to have the largest flag day parade in the nation as well as the oldest. In Washington, D.C., Flag Day is celebrated heavily through the 7th and 8th Wards of the city. It is said that Clyde Thompson is the \"Godfather of Flag Day\". It is tradition in these wards to slow-smoke various meats and vegetables."

    "description": "Juneteenth (a portmanteau of June and nineteenth) \u2013 also known as Freedom Day, Jubilee Day, Liberation Day, and Emancipation Day \u2013 is a holiday celebrating the emancipation of those who had been enslaved in the United States. Originating in Texas, it is now celebrated annually on the 19th of June throughout the United States, with varying official recognition. Specifically, it commemorates Union army general Gordon Granger announcing federal orders in Galveston, Texas, on June 19, 1865, proclaiming that all slaves in Texas were free. President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation had officially outlawed slavery in Texas and the other states in rebellion against the Union almost two and a half years earlier. Enforcement of the Proclamation generally relied on the advance of Union troops. Texas being the most remote of the slave states had a low presence of Union troops as the American Civil War ended; thus enforcement there had been slow and inconsistent before Granger's announcement. Although Juneteenth generally celebrates the end of slavery in the United States, it was still legal and practiced in two Union border states (Delaware and Kentucky) until later that year when ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution abolished chattel slavery nationwide in December. Celebrations date to 1866, at first involving church-centered community gatherings in Texas. It spread across the South and became more commercialized in the 1920s and 1930s, often centering on a food festival. During the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s, it was eclipsed by the struggle for postwar civil rights, but grew in popularity again in the 1970s with a focus on African American freedom and arts. By the 21st century, Juneteenth was celebrated in most major cities across the United States. Activists are campaigning for the United States Congress to recognize Juneteenth as a national holiday. Hawaii, North Dakota and South Dakota are the only states that do not recognize Juneteenth, according to the Congressional Research Service. Modern observance is primarily in local celebrations. Traditions include public readings of the Emancipation Proclamation, singing traditional songs such as \"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot\" and \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\", and reading of works by noted African-American writers such as Ralph Ellison and Maya Angelou. Celebrations include rodeos, street fairs, cookouts, family reunions, park parties, historical reenactments, and Miss Juneteenth contests. The Mascogos, descendants of Black Seminoles, who escaped from U.S. slavery in 1852 and settled in Coahuila, Mexico, also celebrate Juneteenth."

It is celebrated on June 20, the anniversary of Belgrano's death in 1820. This date was designated in 1938. The main seat of the Flag Day commemorations is the National Flag Memorial, in the city of Rosario in Santa Fe Province, where the flag was first hoisted on two artillery batteries in opposite banks of the Paran\u00e1 River. The flag was created on February 27, 1812, but that date is not officially commemorated in any way. The celebration consists of a public meeting, speeches by the municipal and provincial authorities, the attendance of the President, and a parade including members of the military, veterans of the Falklands War, the police force, and a number of civilian organizations and associations. Flag Day was created by law N\u00ba 12,361, on June 8, 1938. Initially, it was a celebration held in a fixed day, but law N\u00ba 24,445 modified it to be commemorated on the third Monday of the month. This design creates long weekends and boosts tourism. Within the jurisdiction of Rosario, however, June 20 is always a non-working day for employees of the municipal and provincial administrations, and for all public and private schools. Hermes Binner made a project of law in 2006 to derogate this modification and restore both celebrations in fixed days, but the proposal expired because of not being treated by the Congress in a whole year. Nevertheless, Binner (governor of Santa Fe by then) and the mayor of Rosario, Miguel Lifschitz, insisted in the 2010 Flag Day that Congress should repeal the law and restore the commemoration to fixed days."

    "description": "The World Vitiligo Day, observed on June 25, is an initiative aimed to build global awareness about vitiligo. Vitiligo occurs in 1-2% of the population worldwide; a loss of color in the skin creating a variety of patterns on the skin from loss of pigment. Vitiligo is often called a disease instead of a disorder and that can have a significantly negative social and/or psychological impact on patients, in part because of numerous misconceptions still present in large parts of the world. The idea of a World Vitiligo Day was first nursed by Steve Haragadon, the founder of the Vitiligo Friends network, and then developed and finalized by Ogo Maduewesi, a Nigerian vitiligo patient who is the founder and Executive Director of the Vitiligo Support and Awareness Foundation (VITSAF). In her words, \u201cWorld Vitiligo Day is a day to create extensive awareness on vitiligo and a day dedicated to all living with vitiligo globally\u201d.The first World Vitiligo Day (also defined as \u201cVitiligo Awareness Day\u201d or \u201cVitiligo Purple Fun day\u201d, from the color chosen as Vitiligo Awareness Color) was observed on June 25, 2011. The choice of June 25 as World Vitiligo Day is a memorial to musical artist Michael Jackson, who suffered from vitiligo from the early 1980s until his death, which occurred on June 25, 2009. The main event of the first World Vitiligo Day occurred at Silverbird Galleria's Artrum in Lagos, Nigeria, with the participation of several volunteers with different experiences (dermatologists, motivational speakers, dancers, artists, comedians, patients), united by the common will of spreading knowledge and awareness about vitiligo. Simultaneously, other events took place in other parts of the world, organized by local associations. In 2012, Vitiligo Research Foundation (VRF), a non-profit organization aiming to fund and fast-track medical research, as well as connect investigators, care providers, patients and philanthropists, to accelerate vitiligo research and relieve suffering of patients, registered the Web domain name 25june.org and joined VITSAF and cooperating organizations to increase the efficacy of their efforts in favor of global vitiligo awareness. A goal of the World Vitiligo Day 2012 was to raise 500,000 signatures to address the United Nations in order to: \n* recognize this disease associated with severe social complications; \n* recognize the desire to pursue multilateral efforts in therapy development and health-care education; \n* designate June 25 as the World Vitiligo Day to be observed by the United Nations and Member States every year."

It commemorates the anniversary of the approval by the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's parliament) of the Constitution of Ukraine on 28 June 1996. At 09:18 on this day back in 1996, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted and enacted the Constitution of Ukraine. The work lasted for over a year. After all delays and scandals, including clashes between the lawmakers, on June 27, 1996, Speaker of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine Oleksandr Moroz offered to work without breaks until full adoption. Having spent almost 24 hours in continuous work in the session hall, Ukrainian lawmakers eventually passed the document with 315 votes in its favor. The centuries of people's lawmaking predated the Constitution of Ukraine in its current form. There was the Russkaya Pravda, the legal code of Kyivan Rus, the Cossack and hetman constitutions, including the Constitution of Pylyp Orlyk (one of the first constitutional documents in Europe), the Constitution of the Ukrainian State of 1918. The effective Basic Law of Ukraine has been amended several times. The adoption of the Constitution in 1996 marked the beginning of the formation and development of Ukraine as a new democratic and independent state. The events of that time provided the basis of the political life of Ukraine, which exists within the government quarter today."

Saba Saba Day in Kenya is remembered as the day in when nation-wide protests took place. On July 7th 1990 Kenyans took to the streets to demand free elections. The politicians who had called for the protests, Kenneth Matiba and Charles Rubia, were beaten up and detained by the then tyrannical dictator President Moi. In present day Kenya, Saba Saba has taken on a new meaning, with human rights defenders (HRDs) such as Defenders Coalition and Social Justice Working Groups such as the Mathare Social Justice Center, asking for respect of the constitution, an end to police brutality and killings, advocating for a favourable legal and policy environment in Kenya. On the 30th anniversary of the Saba Saba, the Kenyan police unlawfully teargassed and arrested activists who had taken to the streets to demand for basic rights. Among other things, they are asking for clean water, good housing and an end to abuse from those who are in power."

The event was established by the Governing Council of the United Nations Development Programme in 1989. It was inspired by the public interest in Five Billion Day on July 11, 1987, the approximate date on which the world's population reached five billion people. World Population Day aims to increase people's awareness on various population issues such as the importance of family planning, gender equality, poverty, maternal health and human rights. The day was suggested by Dr. K.C.Zachariah in which population reaches Five Billion when he worked as Sr Demographer at World Bank. While press interest and general awareness in the global population surges only at the increments of whole billions of people, the world population increases annually by 100 million approximately every 14 months. The world population reached 7,400,000,000 on February 6, 2016; the world population had reached 7,500,000,000 at around 16:21 on April 24, 2017. The world population had reached 7,700,000,000 on year 2019. In November, UNFPA, together with the governments of Kenya and Denmark, will be convening a high-level conference in Nairobi to accelerate efforts to achieve these unmet goals. On World Population Day, advocates from around the world are calling on leaders, policymakers, grassroots organizers, institutions and others to help make reproductive health and rights a reality for all."

    "description": "Sarawak Independence Day (also known as Hari Kemerdekaan Sarawak, Hari Sarawak or Sarawak Day) is a holiday observed on 22 July every year by the state of Sarawak in Malaysia, celebrating the establishment of self-government and de facto independence on 22 July 1963. The official Sarawak Independence Day public holiday was gazetted by the government of Sarawak in 2016 to raise awareness about Sarawak's past and contributions of its past leaders. Despite this official name, there are those who still avoided using this title, due to lack of awareness of its legality (it is, in fact, officially gazetted), while some still argue about its historical accuracy, citing British legislation did not provide for an official, full independence. Nonetheless, there was indeed a degree of de facto independence in the form of self-government ahead of it taking part in the founding of a new federation in the form of Malaysia with other partners. The idea of a Sarawakian holiday was mooted by the Sarawak state government and citizens since 2012, after public discontent about the public holiday Hari Merdeka being too Malaya-centric. The day was officially named Sarawak Independence Day and declared as a public holiday for the first time in 2016."

    "description": "Pioneer Day is an official holiday celebrated on July 24 in the American state of Utah, with some celebrations taking place in regions of surrounding states originally settled by Mormon pioneers. It commemorates the entry of Brigham Young and the first group of Mormon pioneers into the Salt Lake Valley on July 24, 1847, where the Latter-day Saints settled after being forced from Nauvoo, Illinois, and other locations in the eastern United States. Parades, fireworks, rodeos, and other festivities help commemorate the event. Similar to July 4, many local and all state-run government offices and many businesses are closed on Pioneer Day. In addition to being an official holiday in Utah, Pioneer Day is considered a special occasion by many members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). On Pioneer Day, some Latter-day Saints walk portions of the Mormon Trail or reenact entering the Salt Lake Valley by handcart. Latter-day Saints throughout the United States and around the world may celebrate July 24 in remembrance of the LDS Church's pioneer era, with songs, dances, potlucks, and pioneer related activities. While the holiday has strong links to the LDS Church, it is officially a celebration for everyone, regardless of faith and nationality, who emigrated to the Salt Lake Valley during the pioneer era, which is generally considered to have ended with the 1869 arrival of the transcontinental railroad. Notable non-LDS American pioneers from this period include Episcopal Bishop Daniel S. Tuttle, who was responsible for Utah's first non-Mormon schools (Rowland Hall-St. Mark's) and first public hospital (St. Mark's) in the late 19th century. The Intertribal Powwow at Liberty Park in Salt Lake City honors the cultural heritage and contributions of the area's Native Americans, helping Utahns to gain a deeper understanding of the region's history."

This holiday is related to the legend of the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus, but rather than a religious festival, it is more of an informal celebration. The tradition of the Sleepy Head Day traces back to the Middle Ages, when the belief was that the person in the household who slept late on this day would be lazy and non-productive for the rest of the year. In the old days, the last person sleeping in the house (also dubbed as the \"laziest\") could be woken up by using water, either by being thrown into a lake or the sea, or by having water thrown on them. In the city of Naantali, a Finnish celebrity is chosen every year to be thrown in the sea from the city's port at 7 a.m. The identity of the sleeper is kept secret until the event. People who are chosen have usually done something to the benefit of the city. Every city mayor has thus far been thrown to the sea at least once, but other sleepers have included the president Tarja Halonen's husband, Dr Pentti Araj\u00e4rvi, the CEO of Neste Oil Risto Rinne, along with many writers, artists and politicians. The celebrations continue into the evening in Naantali and include activities for people of every age."

During the ensuing years of the 1890s, the holiday continued to be observed privately by loyalists of the monarchy as a form of opposition and resistance.

The event is marked by military parades, equipment reviews, showcases and remembrances by all branches of the Polish Armed Forces across the country. One of the most prominent events of the day is in the capital Warsaw, which hosts a large military parade through the city's center. Originally celebrated during the Second Republic, the holiday was barred by authorities during the communist era beginning in 1947, only to be revived again in 1992."

    "description": "Ferragosto is a public holiday celebrated on 15 August in all of Italy. It originates from Feriae Augusti, the festival of emperor Augustus, who made the 1st of August a day of rest after the weeks of hard work of the agricultural sector. It became a custom for the workers to wish their employers \"buon ferragosto\" and they would get a monetary bonus. This became law during the Renaissance throughout the papal states. As the festivity was created for political reasons, the Catholic Church decided to move the festivity to the 15th of August which is the Assumption of Mary allowing them to include this in the festivity. This festivity was also used by Mussolini to give the lower classes the possibility to visit cultural cities or go to the seaside for one to three days, from the 14th of August to the 16th, by creating \"holiday trains\" with extremely low cost tickets, for this holiday period. Food and board was not included, this is why even today Italians associate packed lunches and barbecues with this day. By metonymy, it is also the summer vacation period around mid-August, which may be a long weekend (ponte di ferragosto) or most of August. Up until around 10 years ago, 90% of companies, shops and industries closed but, with the growing influence from other non-Catholic countries, and the fact that closing an entire country's industry for a whole month meant an incredible loss of money and backlog of work, most companies now close for around two weeks, forcing all workers to take imposed vacation, similarly for the 25th of December."

The treaty granted a complete neutral relation between Afghanistan and Britain. Afghanistan had become a British protectorate after it was defeated in the Second Anglo-Afghan War. The First Anglo-Afghan War (1839\u20131842) led to the British force taking and occupying Kabul. After this, due to strategic errors by Elphinstone, the entire British-led Indian invasion force was defeated by Afghan forces under Akbar Khan somewhere at the Kabul-Jalalabad Road, near the city of Jalalabad. After this defeat, the British-led forces returned to Afghanistan on a special mission to rescue their prisoners of war (POWs) and afterward withdrew until coming back in order to commence the Second Anglo-Afghan War. The Second Anglo-Afghan War (1878\u201380) first led to the British defeat followed by their victory at the Battle of Kandahar, which led to Abdur Rahman Khan becoming the new emir and the start of friendly British-Afghan relations. The British were given control of Afghanistan's foreign affairs in exchange for protection against the Russians and Persians. The Third Anglo-Afghan War in 1919 led the British to give up control of Afghanistan's foreign affairs finally in 1921. At the centenary anniversary in 2019, some international landmarks hoisted the Afghan flag tricolor, including the world's tallest building Burj Khalifa in Dubai. The day also coincidenced with the completion of the renovation of the Darul Aman Palace in Kabul, where official celebrations took place."

One of three holidays in Russian Orthodox Christianity on which food items are blessed at church and then consumed by the faithful rather than priests, akin to the First Fruits of Judaism. The others are the Honey Feast of the Saviour, which is celebrated on August 14 (or August 1, Julian Calendar) and the Nut Feast of the Saviour, which is celebrated on August 29 (or August 16, Julian Calendar). The holiday has a pre-Christian origin and is associated with harvesting of ripe fruits, especially apples. In East Slavic folklore, it marks the beginning of autumn and means the transfiguration of nature. In the Byzantine Empire there was tradition to bless harvested grapes during the Feast of Transfiguration. In Russia, apples are more common than grapes, hence the name of the feast. There are processions and blessings of harvests. Usually, on that day, people from Russia, Ukraine and Belarus eat apples, apple pies, or other dishes containing apples, even if they are not Orthodox Christians. \n*       \n*       \n*       \n*       \n*       \n*"

It is observed on 23 August and symbolizes the rejection of \"extremism, intolerance and oppression\". It is one of the official remembrance days of the European Union. Under the name Black Ribbon Day it is also an official remembrance day of Canada and the United States, among other countries. The remembrance day has its origins in protests in western countries against the Soviet Union in the 1980s, that inspired the Baltic Way, a major demonstration during the Revolutions of 1989. It was proposed as an official European remembrance day by V\u00e1clav Havel, Joachim Gauck and a group of freedom fighters and former political prisoners from Central and Eastern Europe, and was formally designated by the European Parliament in 2008/2009 as \"a Europe-wide Day of Remembrance for the victims of all totalitarian and authoritarian regimes, to be commemorated with dignity and impartiality\"; it has been observed annually by the bodies of the European Union since 2009. The European Parliament's 2009 resolution on European conscience and totalitarianism, co-sponsored by the European People's Party, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, The Greens\u2013European Free Alliance, and the Union for Europe of the Nations, called for its implementation in all of Europe. The establishment of 23 August as an international remembrance day for victims of totalitarianism was also supported by the 2009 Vilnius Declaration of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly. 23 August was chosen to coincide with the date of the signing of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, a 1939 non-aggression pact between the USSR and Nazi Germany which contained a protocol dividing Romania, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Finland into designated German and Soviet spheres of influence. The treaty was described by the European Parliament's president Jerzy Buzek in 2010 as \"the collusion of the two worst forms of totalitarianism in the history of humanity.\" The purpose of the Day of Remembrance is to preserve the memory of the victims of mass deportations and exterminations, while promoting democratic values with the aim to reinforce peace and stability in Europe."

In 2013, Kim Jong-un elevated the holiday to an official status on the North Korean calendar, on par with the Day of the Sun (birth anniversary of Kim Il-sung). Thus it became the holiday associated with Kim Jong-un, with his own birthday still missing from the official calendar. This has helped to further Kim Jong-un's charismatic rule. According to North Korea analyst Adam Cathcart, the purpose of the holiday is \"to reinforce Kim Jong-un's legitimacy to rule, confirm the principle of very early succession and young leadership, and emphasize the preternatural military abilities of the sons in the Kim family.\" On the calendar, the 25 August holiday takes place after the Liberation Day (15 August) and before the Day of the Foundation of the Republic (\uc778\ubbfc\uc815\uad8c_\ucc3d\uac74\uc77c) (9 September).

    "description": "Repentance Day, on 26 August, is a public holiday in Papua New Guinea. It is celebrated by \"prayer ceremonies\" across the country. It was established on 15 August 2011 by Prime Minister Peter O'Neill, who had come to power less than two weeks earlier. The announcement came only eleven days before the first Repentance Day was to be celebrated. It was made a public holiday at the request of \"a group of churches\", which had initially submitted the request to O'Neill's predecessor Sam Abal, before the latter was ousted in a motion of no confidence. Virtually no explanation of the day's purpose was provided by the government, reportedly creating some confusion among Papua New Guineans as 26 August arrived. Pastor Jack Edward of the Shema Evangelism Ministry was made Repentance Day coordinator, and said the purpose was for people to \"come together and pray and ask the Lord to forgive us for the wrongs that are happening in our nation\". It was intended as a day of Christian prayer, in a predominantly Christian nation. Imam , described by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation as the \"spiritual leader\" of Papua New Guinea's \"4,000 practising Muslims\", said he did not oppose the idea, but it might send a \"wrong message\", as repentance should occur every time a wrong is committed, rather than once a year. As the day was little publicised, many businesses were initially uncertain whether it was indeed supposed to be a public holiday, requiring them to give their employees the day off or pay them double. The Port Moresby Chamber of Commerce obtained a copy of the Government Gazette to convince its members that it was indeed a public holiday. On 26 August 2011, prayer ceremonies were held in churches throughout the country. In Port Moresby, the capital, a ceremony at the Rev Sioni Kami Memorial church was attended by \"representatives of 20 provinces\" and various \"national leaders\" and \"church leaders\", for \"special prayer and Bible readings\" and \"thanksgiving prayers\". Participants asked God to lead the nation. A parish priest in Boroko was reported by The National as saying that religious values were \"essential to our identity and our culture\", and people's church attendance on such a public holiday revealed a difference between Papua New Guinean identity and that of many other countries. On Karanget Island in Madang, the day was celebrated through children depositing the national flag on a church altar, symbolically \"deliver[ing] the nation to God\"."

The impulse for the day came from the  (Federaci\u00f3n Latinoamericana de Asociaciones de Familiares de Detenidos-Desaparecidos, or FEDEFAM), a non-governmental organization founded in 1981 in Costa Rica as an association of local and regional groups actively working against secret imprisonment, forced disappearances and abduction in a number of Latin-American countries. Work on secret imprisonment is an important part of the activities for a number of international bodies and organizations in the fields of human rights activism and humanitarian aid, including for example Amnesty International (AI), the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The International Day of the Disappeared is an opportunity to highlight these institutions' work, increase public awareness, and to call for donations and volunteers. Of those agencies, the ICRC has additional privileges due to its special status as a non-governmental sovereign entity and its strict policy of neutrality. In some cases, the ICRC is the only institution granted access to specific groups of prisoners, thereby enabling a minimum level of contact and inspection of their treatment. For affected families, messages transmitted by the ICRC are often the only hint about the fate of these prisoners. Visiting those detained in relation to conflicts and enabling them to restore and maintain contact with their families, is a very important part of the ICRC's mandate. But the definition of the Missing or the Disappeared goes far beyond the victims of enforced disappearance. It includes all those whose families have lost contact as the result of conflicts, natural disasters or other tragedies. These missing may be detained, stranded in foreign countries, hospitalized or dead. Through its tracing services and working with the 189 national Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world, the ICRC seeks to obtain information about their fate on behalf of their families. It reminds governments and other groups of their obligations to respect the families' right to know the fate of their loved ones. It also works with families of the missing to help them address their particular psychological, social legal and financial needs. Imprisonment under secret or uncertain circumstances is a grave violation of some conceptions of human rights as well as, in the case of an armed conflict, of International Humanitarian Law. The General Assembly of the United Nations adopted a  as resolution 47/133 on December 18, 1992. It is estimated that secret imprisonment is practiced in about 30 countries. The OHCHR Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances has registered about 46,000 cases of people who disappeared under unknown circumstances. On August 30, 2007, hundreds of Philippine relatives and supporters of desaparecidos, mostly activists, missing after being abducted or killed by Philippine security forces protested against the government to mark International Day of the Disappeared. Edita Burgos remembered her missing son, Jonas, a member of the Peasants' Movement of the Philippines. On August 30, 2008 the International Coalition against Enforced Disappearances, which gathers family member organizations and human rights organizations from around the world, joined hands for a global campaign event to promote the ratification of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance."

While North Borneo Self-government Day is often referred to as 'Independence Day', this is strictly speaking incorrect, since British legislation on North Borneo's self-government did not provide for its independence prior to it joining to form the federation of Malaysia. In 2018, the Borneo Heritage Foundation (BHF) has called the state government to gazette the day as \"Sabah Day\" and declare it as a state holiday."

It commemorates the unification of Eastern Rumelia and Bulgaria in 1885. By the terms of the Treaty of Berlin (1878), Southern Bulgaria (named Eastern Roumelia) was separated from the newly formed Bulgarian state and returned to the Ottoman Empire with partial autonomy. Bulgarian citizens considered the decisions of the Berlin Treaty to be unfair and began a peaceful demonstration against them. At first the plan was to annex all territories that Bulgaria had gained after the Treaty of San Stefano but later it became clear that was impossible because of the unsuitable international situation. The Bulgarians had to leave Macedonia and the rest of Thrace and concentrate on the East Roumelian issue. The first actions were taken in 1880 but the sharpened political situation, economic instability and the low prestige of the Bulgarian country delayed the resolution of the so-called \"national question\". In 1884 the \"Macedonian committees\" were the main body working on the unsolved problem. On 10 February 1885 led by Zahari Stoyanov a group of former revolutionaries founded in Plovdiv (the capital of Eastern Roumelia) a secret committee known as BSCRC \u2013 Bulgarian Secret Central Revolutionary Committee (Bulgarian: \u0411\u0422\u0426\u0420\u041a \u2013 \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0422\u0430\u0435\u043d \u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d \u0420\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0435\u043d \u041a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442). It had regulations and programs which were connected to the organisation led by Vasil Levski, Hristo Botev and Lyuben Karavelov before the Liberation. After a few months BSCRC had improved their plan for actions and organised some public events on dates significant to Bulgarians. The conference in  () on 24\u201326 July and the next meeting on 23 August declared what should be done and exactly how to proceed. On 5 September 1885 the people rose in Goliamo Konare (Saedinenie) and after arresting the prefect of Plovdiv the militia advanced toward the capital. On 6 September the palace in Plovdiv was surrounded. The governor Gavril Krastevich did not alert the Turks in Istanbul and proclaimed his support of the people's cause. A temporary government headed by Georgi Stranski took control of the situation and armed forces were commanded by major Danail Nikolaev who began preparation for war with the Ottoman Empire. On 8 September knyaz Alexander received a telegram in the old capital Tarnovo which he was already expecting. His army was prepared and waiting for a signal. He agreed to become a leader of the Unified Bulgaria. On the next day (9 September) the knyaz arrived in Plovdiv and the temporary government was dismissed. Diplomatic efforts failed and Bulgaria had to defend its interests on the battlefield in the Serbo-Bulgarian War where the Bulgarians were victorious."

It has been a national holiday since 1991, when a referendum for Independence took place. Then SR Macedonia gained its independence from Yugoslavia, where it was a federal state, and became a sovereign parliamentary democracy. On September 8, 1991, over 95.5% of the 75.8% turnout voters on the Referendum voted for the independence of the Republic Macedonia. \"Dear citizens of Macedonia, allow me tonight to you and to all citizens of Macedonia to congratulate the free, sovereign and independent Macedonia!\" - said the President of the then Republic of Macedonia Kiro Gligorov on the evening of September 8, addressing the citizens who spontaneously gathered at Macedonia Square in the capital Skopje, to celebrate the successful referendum. The people's will for an independent state was confirmed with the Declaration of the referendum results on September 18, 1991, by the first multi-party Macedonian Parliament. Finally, on 25 September 1991, the Declaration of Independence was adopted by the Macedonian Parliament. Next, the new Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia was adopted on 17 November 1991. Due to Greek opposition to a new state containing the term 'Macedonia', the sovereign status of the state was not recognized until April 8, 1993, with an acclamation of the UN General Assembly, when Republic of Macedonia was admitted as 181st full-fledged member in the world organisation under the provisional reference Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. According to some data, September 8 was chosen as a day for the referendum of Independent Macedonia in 1991, which fact was based on the historically significant day - September 8, 1944, when the Independent State of Macedonia was proclaimed."

It celebrates the day the country gained independence from the United Kingdom on 21 September 1964. Throughout its existence, Malta had a long and complex history which resulted in the island being ruled by a plethora of foreign rulers. Such rulers include the likes of the \u201cPhoenicians, Romans, Greeks, Arabs, Normans, Sicilians, Swabians, Aragonese, Hospitallers, French, and British\u201d. Malta's final ruler, Britain, granted Malta self-governance after Malta's brave resistance to the Axis powers and loyalty to Britain during World War Two, which did allow for the movement for independence to grow more in popularity. Malta attained independence from the British Empire and joined the Commonwealth of Nations in 1964 and declared itself a republic a decade later, known as Republic Day. The Maltese people greatly celebrate the occasion with many activities and ceremonies. The number of activities change every year, but there won't ever be a shortage of them. \u201cThere are numerous parades, festivals, musical performances, and cultural events all over the island of Malta and the smaller island of Gozo\u201d. Every Sunday during the months of March to December, the \u201cIn Guardia Parades\u201d, a series of historical re-enactments of past battles by veteran reenactors, is played."

The day had been recognised as International Right to Know Day since 2002 and was developed by international civil society advocates beginning in 2012. The UNESCO resolution creating the day was pushed by African civil society groups seeking greater information transparency. Currently only 17 African Union member states have adopted national right to information laws, and groups like Open Government Partnership hope that the recognition of the right to information will \"provide an important platform for all stakeholders at national level to discuss the adoption and effective implementation of national right to information laws in line with continental and international standards and obligations.\" However, African civil society groups like MISA Zimbabwe have noted that states like Zimbabwe which do have Right to Information laws still have a long way to go to ensure they improve governance. In 2016, MISA Zimbabwe used Access to Information Day to criticise Zimbabwe's poor information transparency provisions, noting that, \"While Zimbabwe was one of the first African countries to adopt an access to information law in the form of the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA), the law in question is a far cry from its purported import and impact.\""

The foundational belief is that homophobia thrives in an atmosphere of silence and ignorance, and that once people know that they have loved ones who are lesbian or gay, they are far less likely to maintain homophobic or oppressive views."

    "description": "The Jidai Matsuri (\u6642\u4ee3\u796d, \"Festival of the Ages\") is a traditional Japanese festival (also called matsuri) held annually on October 22 in Kyoto, Japan. It is one of Kyoto's renowned three great festivals, with the other two being the Aoi Matsuri, held annually on May 15, and the Gion Matsuri, which is held annually from 17 to July 24. It is a festival enjoyed by people of all ages, participating in its historical reenactment parade dressed in authentic costumes representing various periods, and characters in Japanese feudal history. Jidai Matsuri traces its roots to the relocation of the Japanese capital from Kyoto to Tokyo during the Meiji Restoration in 1868. This involved the relocation of the Emperor of Japan and the Imperial family, the Imperial Palace, and thousands of government officials and subjects to the new city. Fearing for Kyoto's loss of glory and interest from her people, and to commemorate its history, the city government and the Kyoto prefectural government commemorated the 1100th anniversary of the founding of Heian-ky\u014d (\u5e73\u5b89\u4eac), which was the former name of Kyoto, in 794 by Emperor Kanmu (\u6853\u6b66\u5929\u7687, Kanmu-tenn\u014d) (737\u2013806). To inaugurate the first Jidai celebration in 1895, the city government built the Heian Shrine (\u5e73\u5b89\u795e\u5bae, Heian jing\u016b) to enshrine the spirit of Emperor Kanmu. To add meaning to the festival, it staged a costume procession representing people of each era in Kyoto history. In 1940, the local government decided that on top of honouring Emperor Kanmu, the Jidai festival was also to be held in honour of Emperor K\u014dmei (\u5b5d\u660e\u5929\u7687, K\u014dmei-tenn\u014d) (July 22, 1831 \u2013 January 30, 1867) for his work in unifying the country, the power of the imperial court and the affirmation of Kyoto as the center of Japan at the decline of the Tokugawa shogunate and the end of the Edo period. The Jidai Matsuri begins in early morning with the mikoshi (portable shrines) brought out of the Kyoto Imperial Palace so that people may pay their respects. The mikoshi represents both Emperor Kanmu and Emperor K\u014dmei. The five-hour, two-kilometer costume procession begins in the afternoon, with approximately 2,000 performers dressed as samurai, military figures, and common people, from the earliest eras to the Meiji era. These are followed by Japanese women who are dressed in elaborate j\u016bnihitoe (\u5341\u4e8c\u5358\u8863, juunihitoe). Finally, the mikoshi are carried from the palace and are accompanied by a costumed military band that plays the gagaku. The procession ends at the Heian Shrine. The Jidai Matsuri in 2019 is rescheduled to 26 October due to the Enthronement ceremony of Emperor Naruhito. \n*       \n*       \n*"

On May 17, 1972, the  UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) proposed measures for information dissemination and for the mobilization of public opinion relative to trade and development problems. These became known as resolution 3038 (XXVII), which the UN General Assembly passed on December 19, 1972. This resolution called for introducing World Development Information Day to help draw the attention of people worldwide to development problems. A further aim of the event is to explain to the general public why it is necessary to strengthen international cooperation to find ways to solve these problems. The assembly also decided that the day should coincide with United Nations Day to stress the central role of development in the UN's work. World Development Information Day was first held on October 24, 1973, and has been held on this date each year since then. In recent years many events have interpreted the title of the day slightly differently. These have concentrated on the role that modern information-technologies, such as the Internet and mobile telephones free from digital divide can play in alerting people and finding solutions to problems of trade and development. One of the specific aims of World Development Information Day was to inform and motivate young people and this change may help to further this aim."

    "description": "The Day of the Dead (Spanish: D\u00eda de Muertos) is a Mexican holiday celebrated throughout Mexico, in particular the Central and South regions, and by people of Mexican heritage elsewhere. The multi-day holiday involves family and friends gathering to pray for and remember friends and family members who have died, and helping support their spiritual journey. In Mexican culture, death is viewed as a natural part of the human cycle. Mexicans view it not as a day of sadness but as a day of celebration because their loved ones awaken and celebrate with them. In 2008, the tradition was inscribed in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO. The holiday is sometimes called D\u00eda de los Muertos in Anglophone countries, a back-translation of its original Mexican name, D\u00eda de Muertos. It is particularly celebrated in Mexico where the day is a public holiday. Prior to Spanish colonization in the 16th century, the celebration took place at the beginning of summer. Gradually, it was associated with October 31, November 1, and November 2 to coincide with the Western Christian triduum of Allhallowtide: All Saints' Eve, All Saints' Day, and All Souls' Day. Traditions connected with the holiday include building private altars called ofrendas, honoring the deceased using calaveras, aztec marigolds, and the favorite foods and beverages of the departed, and visiting graves with these as gifts. Visitors also leave possessions of the deceased at the graves. Scholars trace the origins of the modern Mexican holiday to indigenous observances dating back hundreds of years and to an Aztec festival dedicated to the goddess Mictecacihuatl. It has become a national symbol and as such is taught (for educational purposes) in the nation's schools. Many families celebrate a traditional \"All Saints' Day\" associated with the Catholic Church. Originally, the Day of the Dead as such was not celebrated in northern Mexico, where it was unknown until the 20th century because its indigenous people had different traditions. The people and the church rejected it as a day related to syncretizing pagan elements with Catholic Christianity. They held the traditional \"All Saints' Day\" in the same way as other Christians in the world. There was limited Mesoamerican influence in this region, and relatively few indigenous inhabitants from the regions of Southern Mexico, where the holiday was celebrated. In the early 21st century in northern Mexico, D\u00eda de Muertos is observed because the Mexican government made it a national holiday based on educational policies from the 1960s; it has introduced this holiday as a unifying national tradition based on indigenous traditions."

The day draws attention to the low global conviction rate for violent crimes against journalists and media workers, estimated at only one in every ten cases. As these individuals play a critical role in informing and influencing the public about important social issues, impunity for attacks against them has a particularly damaging impact, limiting public awareness and constructive debate. On 2 November, organizations and individuals worldwide are encouraged to talk about the unresolved cases in their countries, and write to government and intra-governmental officials to demand action and justice. UNESCO organizes an awareness-raising campaign on the findings of the UNESCO Director-General's biennial Report on the Safety of Journalists and the Danger of Impunity, which catalogues the responses of states to UNESCO\u2019s formal request for updates on progress in cases of killings of journalists and media workers. UNESCO and civil society groups throughout the world also use 2 November as a launch date for other reports, events and other advocacy initiatives relating to the problem of impunity for crimes against freedom of expression."

The day celebrates the Swedish-speaking population of Finland, their culture, and the bilinguality of Finland. The main celebrations are aired on the radio, and many smaller celebrations are held around Finland in schools. Usually, the song Modersm\u00e5lets s\u00e5ng is sung, celebrating the mother tongue. The Finnish Swedish Heritage Day is celebrated on the same day as Gustavus Adolphus Day in Sweden, the day that king Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden was killed at the Battle of L\u00fctzen in 1632. The Finland Swedish Heritage Day was created in 1908, when the newly founded Swedish People's Party of Finland decided to celebrate a day for the Swedes. The intention was to strengthen the Swedish-speaking Finnish community. The reason why the day of the death of king Gustavus Adolphus was chosen was because this also was the time when the empire of Sweden was founded. In the beginning, the celebrations largely circled around the king's persona. During the language strife of the 1930s the celebrations were overshadowed by street fights between Finnish and Swedish groups. Finnish-speaking students saw this day as a day for celebrating \"aggressive imperialism\". During the Second World War, both sides stopped fighting each other and emphasized that both language groups were part of Finland, thus the celebration of the day spread outside the political spectrum. Today, the day is led by Swedish Assembly of Finland."

A holiday canon was established during the Stalinist period, and included a workers' demonstration, the appearance of leaders on the podium of the Mausoleum, and, finally, the military parade on Red Square, which was held unfailingly every year, and most famously in 1941, as the Axis forces were advancing on Moscow. October Revolution Day, which had been the main holiday of the year during the Stalinist period, gradually lost importance in the 1970s, falling behind the Victory Day and New Year celebrations."

But, according to Thomas R. Gowenlock, an intelligence officer with the U.S. First Division, shelling from both sides continued for the rest of the day, only ending at nightfall. The armistice initially expired after a period of 36 days and had to be extended several times. A formal peace agreement was only reached when the Treaty of Versailles was signed the following year. The date is a national holiday in France, and was declared a national holiday in many Allied nations. However, many Western countries and associated nations have since changed the name of the holiday from Armistice Day, with member states of the Commonwealth of Nations adopting Remembrance Day, and the United States government opting for Veterans Day.

Remembrance Day is observed on 11 November in most countries to recall the end of hostilities of First World War on that date in 1918. Hostilities formally ended \"at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month\", in accordance with the armistice signed by representatives of Germany and the Entente between 5:12 and 5:20 that morning. (\"At the 11th hour\" refers to the passing of the 11th hour, or 11:00 am.) The First World War officially ended with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles on 28 June 1919. The tradition of Remembrance Day evolved out of Armistice Day. The initial Armistice Day was observed at Buckingham Palace, commencing with King George V hosting a \"Banquet in Honour of the President of the French Republic\" during the evening hours of 10 November 1919. The first official Armistice Day was subsequently held on the grounds of Buckingham Palace the following morning. During the Second World War, many countries changed the name of the holiday.

The holiday has ironically also become a popular date to celebrate relationships (to \"pair up singles\"), with over 4,000 couples being married in Beijing on this date in 2011, compared to an average of 700 a day. The holiday has become the largest offline and online shopping day in the world, with Alibaba shoppers exceeding 213.5 billion yuan (USD $30.7 billion) in purchase during the 2018 celebration. Rival JD.com hosts an eleven-day shopping festival as well, which garnered USD $19.1 billion, bringing the Chinese total to USD $44.5 billion. In 2019, Alibaba said that its gross merchandise volume for the whole event came in at 268.4 billion yuan (USD $38.4 billion), an increase of 26 percent from the previous year."

    "description": "Veterans Day (originally known as Armistice Day) is a federal holiday in the United States observed annually on November 11, for honoring military veterans, that is, persons who have served in the United States Armed Forces (and were discharged under conditions other than dishonorable). It coincides with other holidays including Armistice Day and Remembrance Day which are celebrated in other countries that mark the anniversary of the end of World War I. Major hostilities of World War I were formally ended at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918, when the Armistice with Germany went into effect. At the urging of major U.S. veteran organizations, Armistice Day was renamed Veterans Day in 1954. Veterans Day is distinct from Memorial Day, a U.S. public holiday in May. Veterans Day celebrates the service of all U.S. military veterans, while Memorial Day honors those who had died while in military service. There is another military holiday, Armed Forces Day, a U.S. remembrance that also occurs in May, which honors those currently serving in the U.S. military. Additionally, Women Veterans Day is recognized by a growing number of U.S. states that specifically honors women who have served in the U.S. military."

The Hon Peter Garrett provided a Declaration of Support for World Kindness Australia and placed World Kindness Day on the National School Calendar for over 9000 schools. Schools across the globe are now celebrating World Kindness Day and work with local NGOs such as the Be Kind People Project and Life Vest Inside In the USA.

It is not a national public holiday, however, Federal government institutions are closed on this day. Traditionally, a Te Deum is sung as well as a private observance being held. November 15 is the name day of Leopold (the feast of Saint Leopold in the German liturgical calendar) and Albert (the feast of Saint Albert the Great in the General Roman Calendar). In 1951, King Baudouin decided to honor November 15, as did his brother King Albert II. During the regency of Prince Charles, the designations Day of the Dynasty or Feast of the Dynasty were used, and these terms are still often erroneously used.

Yuri's Day in the Autumn, celebrated after the end of the agricultural year and the gathering of the harvest, had a special significance on the calendar of Russian peasants during the centuries when the system of Russian serfdom was becoming established. The Sudebnik of 1497 defined the two weeks' period around the Autumn Yuri's Day (one week before the feast and one week after it), as the only time of the year when Russian peasants were free to move from one landowner to another. A century later, in 1597, Boris Godunov's regency forbade the movement of peasants on Yuri's day, thus finalizing the evolution of Russian serfdom. A popular Russian expression harking back to that unfortunate event still survives (\"\u0432\u043e\u0442 \u0442\u0435\u0431\u0435, \u0431\u0430\u0431\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430, \u0438 \u042e\u0440\u044c\u0435\u0432 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c\", roughly translated: \"so much for Yuri's Day, Granny\", referring to a broken promise or, more generally, to any failed expectation).

The broader and ultimate aim of the event is to promote basic humanitarian values. Inaugurated in 1992 on 7 February by Thomas Oaster, the project of International Men's Day was conceived one year earlier on 8 February 1991. The project was re-initialised in 1999 in Trinidad and Tobago. The longest running celebration of International Men's Day is Malta, where events have occurred since 7 February 1994. Jerome Teelucksingh, who revived the event, chose 19 November to honour his father's birthday and also to celebrate how on that date in 1989 Trinidad and Tobago's football team had united the country with their endeavours to qualify for the World Cup. Teelucksingh has promoted International Men's Day as not just a gendered day but a day where all issues affecting men and boys can be addressed. He has said of IMD and its grass roots activists, \"They are striving for gender equality and patiently attempt to remove the negative images and the stigma associated with men in our society\"."

    "description": "Blue Beanie Day is an annual international celebration of web standards which began in 2007. It was originated by Douglas Vos and popularized by Jeffrey Zeldman, the author of Designing with Web Standards. The commemoration, which is accompanied by web developers sharing photographs of themselves in blue beanies, seeks to raise awareness of web design features such as progressive enhancement and accessible, semantic markup and \"fight Web Standards Apathy\". Users use the hashtag #BlueBeanieDay, change their social media avatars to show themselves in blue headgear, and share information and links to content promoting the open web and online accessibility. The origin of the name of the holiday is the image of Jeffrey Zeldman on the cover of his book wearing a blue toque. Over the years, the Blue Beanie Day also became an action day for web accessibility, as the correct use of web standards is the basic requirement for it."

From 1948, during the period of Communist administration, the national holiday was on 23 August, Liberation from Fascist Occupation Day, to mark the 1944 overthrow of the pro-fascist government of Marshal Ion Antonescu, with parades held on Charles de Gaulle Square (then called Stalin Square and Aviators' Square)."

Traditionally, adults and children wearing disguise go around houses in the villages dancing and singing the story of Saint Barbara; and in each house, they are offered food specially prepared for that feast (and sometimes money). It is celebrated in honour of the Christian Saint and Martyr Saint Barbara. The general belief among Lebanese Christians is that Saint Barbara disguised herself as many different characters to elude the Romans who were persecuting her."

The observance of Christmas was introduced once with the Christianization of Romania but it was then interrupted during the Communist period (1948\u20141989), as concepts as religion, Jesus Christ or the Church were banned. In the post-communist Romania, Christmas started being celebrated again more festively. The Christmas and holiday season starts officially on November 30, on Saint Andrew's day and ends on January 7, with the celebration of Saint John. Other major holidays in this period are Great Union Day, Saint Nicholas' Day, Saint Ignatius' Day, Christmas Eve (Ajunul Craciunului in Romanian), Christmas Day (Craciun in Romanian), Saint Stephen's day, New Year's Eve (Revelion in Romanian), and the Epiphany."

    "description": "A Julotta (\"Jul\": Yule; Christmas, \"otta\": dawn) is a Swedish term for the matin on Christmas Day, 25 December, that celebrates the nativity of Jesus Christ. The service is held every 25 December early on Christmas morning; at 7 a.m. in most church buildings, but in some churches it is celebrated at 10 a.m., or as early as 4 a.m. During previous centuries, most Julottas were held at 4 a.m. Traditionally, the service should end before, or at the time of, dawn: hence the word \"otta\" is the time just before dawn. Historically in the Church of Sweden the clergy was obliged not only to say the high mass but also matins (Swedish: ottes\u00e5ng) and evensong (Swedish: aftons\u00e5ng); today only the evensong of Christmas remain but has been liturgically changed since and can now be the main service of Christmas Day, wherefore many parishes have no mid-morning high mass on Christmas Day."

Between 1991 and 2005, the holiday used to be known simply as Independence Day. The current name was adopted in September 2005, following the proposal of the then-opposition Social Democrats, in order to emphasize the national consensus at the time of the 1990 referendum, which was supported by all political parties represented in the  at the time. Independence and Unity Day is not to be confused with Slovenia's Statehood Day, which is celebrated each year on June 25, in honour of the declaration of Slovenian independence from Yugoslavia in 1991."
